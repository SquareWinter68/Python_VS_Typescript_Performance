# Python_vs_Typescript_performance

## Description

This is an effort to show the performance speeds of both python and typescript compared to eachother.
To achieve this I implemented thr MergeSort algorithm in both programming languages. This algorithm should conventionally
have a time complexity of O(n*log(n)), since the implementations are the same in bote languages the only restraint 
should be the languages themselves.
The diferrences are graphed and can be founf under the graphs folder, matplotlib and pygal have been used to make the graphs. 
The code for the graph generation is provided as well

I have lso thought of adding C and C#, to this list after a while. 

*Note yes I am aware that typescript has the same performance as js since it just gets transpiled into javascript anyways.
